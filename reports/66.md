#  H-01
## Vulnerability Code
```solidity
// Should be called by ActivePool
    // __after__ collateral is transferred to this contract from Active Pool
    function receiveCollateral(address[] memory _tokens, uint256[] memory _amounts)
        external
        override
    {
        _requireCallerIsActivePool();
        totalColl.amounts = _leftSumColls(totalColl, _tokens, _amounts);
        emit StabilityPoolBalancesUpdated(_tokens, _amounts);
    }
```


## Analysis
Comment和代码语义不一致
In StabilityPool.sol, the receiveCollateral() function should be called by ActivePool per comments, but anyone can call it passing in _tokens and _amounts args to update stability pool balances.

## Mitigation Steps
Allow only the ActivePool to call the receiveCollateral() function:
```solidity
require(msg.sender = address(active pool address), "Can only be called by ActivePool")
```
